    <h2> HTML </h2>

    <p id="HTML"> During the time that we have began learning about coding, we have begun at the beginning of HTML and reached a point where we can basically do anything to design our own websites. We have learned the different tags that reference <b> headings, paragraphs, lists, images, etc. </b> We have also learned how to style the paragraphs internally, without having to use CSS. After learning, we have been able to add emphasis or even the make the text bolder by using a <strong> strong </strong> tag. An important aspect that we have learned about is how to add images. We learned how to add the tag of image src, then add the link of the image and adjust it by changing its width, height and even to align it to a certain direction. Something really important that we have learned about is the use of internal and external links. We learned how to use the a tag to reference a site that can take us outside of the page or make us able to jump from one place to another. We also learned the super long process that is used to add tables by using the table, tr, th and td tags to format it. Finally, we learned how to use comments, so that the person reading our coding will understand what each part of the coding will do for each part of the website.  </p>

    <h2> CSS </h2>

    <p class="HI"> Using CSS when making our websites has been super fun to use because you can basically style your website any way that you wish. You can reference a certain tag like p, h2, h1, or ol to change its font, background color, color, size and decoration. Any easy way to reference a specific part of your website is to add an ID. If you add an id, you can reference a certain ID (let's say that it is #a) and change its specific composition. You can also use classes and IDs to be able to jump internally from one place to another, just like a table of contents. Something else that is super duper important, is the use of font families. We were able to learn how to change the font of the text that we are using to have a much more interesting font than just serif. Finally we learned the different tags that are used to style our font including: </p>

    <!--Right here I was able to learn how to use Roman Numerals in lists-->

    <ol class= "text" type= "I">

      <li> font-weight </li>
      <li> font-decoration </li>
      <li> font-style </li>
      <li> text-align </li>
      <li> font-size </li> 
      <li> background-color </li>

    </ol>

      <p id= "final-words">I'm super glad that I was able to learn about HTML and CSS </p>
