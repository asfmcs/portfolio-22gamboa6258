  <li> Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line an 8x8-inch *metal* baking pan with foil or parchment, leaving an overhang, and spray with nonstick cooking spray.</li>

  <li> In a large microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate chips, butter, and unsweetened chocolate. Heat in the microwave for 1 minute then stir. Continue heating in 30-second bursts, stirring between each burst, until the mixture is melted and smooth but not scorched. Remove from the microwave and let cool slightly. Stir in the Nutella. </li>

  <li> In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the eggs and sugar on medium-high speed until light and thick, about 3 minutes. Beat in the vanilla extract. Stir in the cooled chocolate mixture with a rubber spatula. Add the flour, cocoa, and salt, folding gently until combined.</li>

  <li> Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake until a tester comes out with moist crumbs still attached, 35 to 40. Do not overbake, you want to error on the side of underbaking. Let cool to room temperature. Serve at room temperature, warmed, or chilled. </li>
