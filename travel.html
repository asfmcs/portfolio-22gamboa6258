   <h2 class= "second-title"> <em>My </em> experience while being there </h2>

   <p> What was really fun about Rome is that it was part of a cruise ship itenerary that included places in Croatia, Montenegro, Malta, Sicily and of course, Italy. I had visited at the beginning of the trip Venice, which was really fun, but it wasn't like my experience while being in Rome. Rome had everything that you could love: </p>

     <li id= "list-1"> <strong> Every </strong> single restaurant (even if it was Italian) was delicious and one to remember </li> <br>

     <li id= "list-1"> Even though there is a lot of people, it feels like you have the city to yourself </li>  <br>

  <h2> My Favorite Part About Rome </h2> 

 <p> There was one day I spent in Rome (out of the three that I was there in total) where I didn't see any other people for most of the way, and that was because I visited the Appian Way. Essentially, the tour was 6 hours long and it could've been longer for this reason: We were using electric bikes that could go up to 50 kilometers per hour and we were also stopping for breaks, museums and going through the city. It was really fun to feel the wind on your face and not have to pedal as much than with a normal bike (if you pedalled a little bit the motor would activate and go immediately.) There were <strong> 5 modes </strong> that you could use: <br> <br> </p>

  <h2> What is the Appian Way? </h2>

  <p> The Appian Way is one of the earliest and strategically more important Roman roads of the ancient republic. It connected Rome to Brindisi, in Southeast Italy. Its importance is indicated by its common name, recorded by Statius.... <br> <br> </p> 

  <h3 class= "latin"><em> Appia longarum... regina viarum </em> <br> <br> 
  "The Appian way the queen of long roads" </h3>

  <h2> Some Of My Favorite Foods </h2> 

  <p> I went to a lot of restaurants during the course of those three days. What really surprised me is how much money we spent everytime that we went and ate. Since this was a trip with my family, which is made up of 16 people, the bills were <strong> really </strong> expensive. But ignoring that, some of my favorite foods included a Mediterrenean pasta that has seafood, pizza (obviously) and any other pasta that I ate were delicious. </p>

<h2> Funny Moments </h2> 

<p> Some of the most funny moments happened when I was together with my family and ironically this moment occured the same day that we did the Appian Way tour. We were picking up our electric bikes from a shop and testing them out until everybody had their  helmets, snacks, water and bike ready. We began going out with our tour guide and we reached a street where we were forced to wait for everyone else. Nobody knew how fast the Turbo mode was, and nobody even tried it. So when we were given the green light to continue, my uncle (who is my dad's brother) decided to try the Turbo as soon as we started going. He realized that it was super quick and started screaming in shock. We all laughed out loud and remembered to <em> never, ever use the Turbo mode in steep climbs. </em> </p>

<h2> The Best Tourist Attractions </h2>

<p> I visited a lot of places during the time that I was in Rome. But some of the best ones that I actually and truly enjoyed are the following: The Roman Forum are a large land of ruins that was once the heart of ancient Rome. They include the Temple of Pius and Saturn. The Trevi Fountain is a super famous baroque fountain that shows you gods like Neptune and the Tritons. There's a legend that says that if you throw a coin in the fountain, you may one day return to Rome. The Vatican Museums, well, <strong> everyone should go there if you're in Rome.</strong> And finally, the Colosseum. Even if it is partially destroyed you can still hear the history of when it was previously used for gladiator fights, public executions or other forms of entertainment. </p>

<h1> That is it!!! Enjoy Rome!!! </h1>
